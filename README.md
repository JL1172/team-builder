# Team - builder 
This provides a home interface, a form with validation, controlled inputs on my form, then utilization of axios in order to post information to be gathered in team member list. This also has a delete function.


## Motivation
I created this project because I wanted to become more proficient with SPAs, form managment, and UX/UI, and form validation. This application mimics a team-builder application in function, where you would add a team member, their information would then be inserted into another list, and you could increase the complexity fairly easily. I build this for scalabilty, therefore the core function has been stress tested, and appending other components would not be a difficult task. 

I always like to build something with the future in mind. I ask myself the questions: "How can I make this perfectly functional, scalable, readable, and maintainable?".
This ensures I can continuously add to my projects as I learn more and become more proficient. 

I love taking the time to make something look really professional and well-done. This project was a blast to make start to finish. It was a fun challenge and I can't wait to add more to it.
