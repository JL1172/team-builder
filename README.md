# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is styled with ReactStrap, Styled-Components and Bootstrap.
I utilized React and React-Router in order to complete this. This provides a home interface, a form with validation, controlled inputs on my form, then utilization of axios in order to post information to be gathered in team member list. This also has a delete function.
